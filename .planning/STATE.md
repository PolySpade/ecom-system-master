# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-11)

**Core value:** The continuous scan → record → save loop must work flawlessly: every scanned barcode reliably stops the previous recording, saves it under the correct name, and starts a new one without missing frames or losing videos.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — full-recording-workflow (planning)

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (scan-record-save-spike) — COMPLETE (2026-07-13)
Plan: 3 of 3 complete
Status: Phase 02 planning next
Last activity: 2026-07-13 -- Hardware validation spike passed on target Windows 11 machine

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~35 min
- Total execution time: ~1.75 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3 | ~105 min | ~35 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~36 min), 01-02 (24 min), 01-03 (~45 min hardware session)
- Trend: steady

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 01 spike: `camera_windows` 0.2.6+4 RETAINED — back-to-back stop→start measured at ~115 ms with zero failures on real hardware (debug and release). `camera_desktop` fallback rejected as unnecessary.
- Phase 01 spike: primary `HardwareKeyboard` handler CONFIRMED focus-independent on Flutter 3.44.6 with a real Bluetooth keyboard-wedge scanner; `useHardwareKeyboardBarcodeListener` stays `true`, Focus fallback dormant.
- Phase 01 spike: validated baseline is Flutter 3.44.6 / Dart 3.12.2 / VS Build Tools 2026 / Windows 11 25H2; Windows Developer Mode is a machine prerequisite (plugin symlinks).
- Recorded output is H.264 (avc1) in MP4 (mp42), video-only — Phase 3 FFmpeg pipeline input confirmed standard.

### Pending Todos

- Phase 2 planning: watermark burn-in strategy (camera_windows records raw frames; timestamp/label/barcode burn-in needs a design decision — likely FFmpeg post-pass or frame-level pipeline).
- Phase 3 prerequisite: FFmpeg/ffprobe is NOT installed on the target machine — bundle or document install.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 exit finding: killing the app mid-recording leaves the in-flight video unfinalized — UI-02 (exit confirmation + stop-and-save) is empirically required, carry into Phase 2 plans.
- Phase 4: Manual exposure/gain/brightness control parity is uncertain — neither `camera_windows` nor `camera_desktop` currently implements this; may need a `win32` FFI shim (IAMCameraControl/IAMVideoProcAmp).
- Phase 3: FFmpeg process-priority control has no clean Dart-native solution (needs `win32` FFI `SetPriorityClass` or `cmd.exe` wrapper) — decide and validate with frame-drop testing during Phase 3 planning.
